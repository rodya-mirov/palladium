TODO for individual features (commits may handle any number of these)

### Easy

- Refactor how the Door system works: door should have a "behavior" enum; hacks should modify this.
  the door update system should NOT be hack aware
- Windows (hackable?)
- Some kind of indicator that the player is "stuck in place" (e.g. when hacking)
- Some kind of indicator in hacks of how long it will take

### Not Easy

- More interesting space background (not just black)

### Big

- Start thinking about more interesting worldgen
- Start thinking about NPCs
- Start thinking about how to plug in skills
- Start thinking about death / rebirth
